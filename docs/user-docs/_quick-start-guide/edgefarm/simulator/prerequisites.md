In order to run the `Train Simulator Demo` you have to establish some prerequisites on the machine that acutally runs the simulator.

If you want to run the simulator on Windows, at least Windows 10 is required.

The simulator runs as Docker containers. Therefore, a Docker environment must be set up beforehand. The files from the simulatore are directly cloned from our Github repository. Thefore, git needs to be installed.

If you already have the following tools up and running you can skip this section and continue directly with [Starting the simulator](/quick-start-guide/edgefarm/simulator/start-simulator/).

The tools needed are:

* docker
* docker-compose
* git

For instructions for your operating system select from below.
