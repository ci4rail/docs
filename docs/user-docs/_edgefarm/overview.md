WELCOME to EdgeFarm. This page gives an overview of EdgeFarm's services.

EdgeFarm consists of three major parts:
1. Device Lifecycle Management (DLM)
2. Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)
3. Application Data Service (ADS)

# Device Lifecycle Management

EdgeFarm DLM manages edge devices, allows monitoring and provides functionality to easily update the firmware of the devices.
The firmware update contains a new Yocto Linux image especially built for the hardware platform.

# Application Lifecycle Management

EdgeFarm ALM manages your applications, which can easily be deployed on the edge devices or in the cloud - you decide!
Those applications are packed as Docker Images and can be managed and monitored using the ALM service in a comfortable way. Setting onto some base applications, you have the full freedom to handle your data according to your needs. Management capability is given by ALM, which allows you to focus on your application.

# Application Data Service

EdgeFarm ADS takes care about the management of your user data. It defines data routes, allows monitoring and filtering as well as exporting to your preferred data system.
