excerpt: Simple example of receiving MQTT data from an external device and transferring the data to the cloud using the train simulator

In this tutorial, you will learn how to receive and process data from MQTT data sources. This tutorial uses the Train Simulator to create the external data. In order to process those external data in your edge device, an application on the edge device is required. You are going to deploy a demo application on the edge device to read the data received from the `Train simulator` and handle them. To keep it simple, our demo application provides a simple dump of the received data. Of course you are free to apply any data handling in a custom application.

# Pre-Conditions

To successfully walk through the next steps, please make sure, that the following actions have been performed.

* `Train simulator` up and running. See the tutorial [Setting up a External Simulation Environment](/edgefarm/tutorials/setup-simulator/) for assistance.
* `EdgeFarm-cli` installed. See [this](/edgefarm/reference-manual/prerequisites/edgefarm-cli/) for assistance.
* Cloned `edgefarm-demos` repository. This is done in [Setting up a External Simulation Environment](/edgefarm/tutorials/setup-simulator/#get-the-train-simulator-up-and-running)).
* Terminal connection to ModuCop. See [Connecting to ModuCop’s Linux Terminal](/edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal/) for assistance.

# Get the IP Address of Your Simulator

On the machine that runs the simulator execute the folloing command to obtain it's IP address.
Run this command to find out all IP addresses. Your local network IP address probably starts with `192.168.x.x` or `10.0.x.x`.

Select your network interface you are interested in to get the ip address.

```
$ nmcli -g ip4.address connection show 'Wired connection 1'

# Connect Simulator Output to Edge Device

In order to connect the simulated data now to the edge device, we are going to apply an updated manifest file which will take care of deploying our demo application to the edge computer. The deployment is performed using the EdgeFarm CLI called `edgefarm`. This quick-start-guide assumes that the CLI is used on the same machine as the simulator is running.

## Modify Manifest File
First of all, please modify the manifest.yaml found in directory `edgefarm-demos/train-simulation/edge`. This is neccessary to establish communication between the application running on the edge device and the machine that runs the simulation.

Enter the IP address of your simulator machine as the value for the key `MQTT_SERVER` in the envs section (line 11).

This example shows how this might look like:

{% highlight yaml linenos %}
application: receive-and-process-data
modules:
  - name: mqtt-bridge
    image: c4rail/mqtt-bridge:latest
    createOptions: '{}'
    imagePullPolicy: on-create
    restartPolicy: always
    status: running
    startupOrder: 1
    envs:
      MQTT_SERVER: 192.168.1.22:1883
  - name: push-temperature
    image:  ci4rail/push-temperature:latest
    createOptions: '{}'
    imagePullPolicy: on-create
    restartPolicy: always
    status: running
    startupOrder: 1
{% endhighlight %}

## Deploy the Application Manifest

Apply the application manifest by the corresponding EdgeFarm command.

```console
$ edgefarm applications apply -f manifest.yaml
```

Now wait for the containers get deployed.
Open the terminal connection to the edge device. You can monitor the status of the deployment by triggering `docker ps` manually and looking for containers called `receive-and-process-data_mqtt-bridge` and `receive-and-process-data_push-temperature`.
Once the deployment is done the output should look similar to this.

```console
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                       COMMAND                 CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                                 NAMES

```


# Verify the Train Simulator Data on Your Device

To verify that everything is properly connected and running, view the logs of the `receive-and-process-data_edge-demo` container by running `docker logs receive-and-process-data_edge-demo -f`. The output should look similar to this.

```console
$ docker logs receive-and-process-data_edge-demo -f
{'device': 'moducop0', 'acqTime': 1620300886, 'payload': b'{"sensorname":"temperature","timestamp":1620300886,"value":"31.57"}'}
{'device': 'moducop0', 'acqTime': 1620300887, 'payload': b'{"sensorname":"temperature","timestamp":1620300887,"value":"30.91"}'}
{'device': 'moducop0', 'acqTime': 1620300888, 'payload': b'{"sensorname":"temperature","timestamp":1620300888,"value":"30.30"}'}
{'device': 'moducop0', 'acqTime': 1620300889, 'payload': b'{"sensorname":"temperature","timestamp":1620300889,"value":"29.75"}'}
```

When you are done abort with `Ctrl+C`.
