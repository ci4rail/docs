> Please [run theme locally](https://github.com/ci4rail/docs/tree/main#run-theme-locally) to see how your changes will behave on the production website.

> Please ensure to install pre-commit hooks every new checkout of the repository to ensure a minimum level of quality every commit. See [Pre-Commit Hooks](https://github.com/ci4rail/docs/blob/main/README.md#pre-commit-hooks) for install instructions.

> For inspiration what can be done with doc pages in this template have a look at the [example page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ci4rail/docs/main/docs/user-docs/_drafts/example.md) which is generated to [http://localhost:4000/example/](http://localhost:4000/example/) when running the server with `--drafts` option.

> Don't use more than 5 heading depths.

# Naming Conventions

**Spell proper names correctly:**
* ModuCop
* EdgeFarm
* EdgeFarm.applications
* EdgeFarm.devices
* EdgeFarm.data
* EdgeFarm.network
* EdgeFarm.monitor
* ... take care of the capital letters!

**For Page Titles and Menu Items:**

* Use well known practices to define a page title, see e.g. [How to Write a News Article: Headlines](https://spcollege.libguides.com/c.php?g=254319&p=1695321).
* Also consider correct capitalizing for headlines, see e.g. [How Should I Capitalize my Headlines](https://www.hipb2b.com/blog/how-should-i-capitalize-my-headlines).


**For File Names and Folders (and so for URLs):**

- Use only small letters
- Do NOT USE SPACES!
- No special characters
- Separate words with `-` e.g. "total great stuff" -> total-great-stuff
- Naming shall reflect the content
- Name of doc page file shall contain title, but shorts can be used e.g. title: `Develop Applications`, file name: `develop-apps.md`

# How-To's
## How to Modify a Page
Assume that the website has the following sidebar and you want to customize the page marked in orange:

<img src="../../user-docs/images/drafts/sidebar.png" alt="Sidebar" height="300px">

Get the URL of the page to find the corresponding file in the directory structore:
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>http://localhost:4000/<strong style="color:red">edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal</strong>/
</code></pre></div>

All docs are stored in docs/user-docs/ and grouped by the category, which has to start with `_`:

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>docs/user-docs/_<strong style="color:red">edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal</strong>.md
</code></pre></div>

Each documentation file has a YAML front matter at the top, eg.:

```yaml
---
title: Connecting to ModuCop's Linux Terminal
excerpt: How to get access to the Shell to configure ModuCop
last_modified_at: 2021-07-22

custom_previous: /edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/no-starter-kit-bom/
custom_next: /edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-internet/
---
```

This is used to define page metadata:
* **title:** Headline of the page and in the browser tab
* **excerpt:** A short description of the page content
* **last_modified_at:** Is updated automatically with pre-commit hooks, shows when the page was updated the last time

Add the content below the front matter.

## How to Add Figures
See the section `Include Figure` from [example markdown page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ci4rail/docs/main/docs/user-docs/_drafts/example.md) / [generated example page](http://localhost:4000/example/#include-figure) to see how to add figures into the page.

Documentation figures are stored in `docs/user-docs/images`. Please mirror the directory structure of your documentation in the image foldes folder. <strong style="color:red">You must not use `_` at the beginning of folders, otherwise the contained images are not accessible</strong>.

> Please consider [naming conventions](#naming-conventions) for file name selection.

> Do not add pictures greater than > 500 KB.

Image located in `docs/user-docs/images/super-image.jpg` results in URL `/user-docs/images/super-image.jpg`.


## How to Add a Page
Assume that the website has the following sidebar and you want to add another page with the title `Demonstration Page` after the page highlighted in orange on the same level:

<img src="../../user-docs/images/drafts/sidebar.png" alt="Sidebar" height="300px">

Get the URL of the page to find the corresponding file in the directory structore:
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>http://localhost:4000/<strong style="color:red">edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal</strong>/
</code></pre></div>

All docs are stored in docs/user-docs/ and grouped by the category, which has to start with `_`:

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>docs/user-docs/_<strong style="color:red">edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal</strong>.md
</code></pre></div>

Add a file in the same directory and give it a name in the format `TITLE_SMALL_WITH_HYPHEN.md`, where `TITLE_SMALL_WITH_HYPHEN` shall be the title converted in small letters where spaces are replaced with `-`. Shorts can be used to keep URLs short, as file names are used to generate the URL.

So a good name for our examle file would be `demo-page.md`.

The next step is to add a front matter at the top of the file:
```yaml
---
title: Demonstration Page
excerpt: This is a page for demonstration.
last_modified_at: 2021-07-22
---
```

After this the page can be visited, as the filename defines the URL together with the filepath:
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>docs/user-docs/_<strong style="color:red">edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/demo-page</strong>.md
</code></pre></div>

Hosting the webside on your local machine, this would be [http://localhost:4000/edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/demo-page/](http://localhost:4000/edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/demo-page/).

But, as you may see, there is stil no reference on the sidebar right now. For this case we need to change the sidebar config file, which is located in `docs/_data/sidebars`. For futher information regarding the sidebar structure, see [section Sidebar](#sidebar).

Search for the reference file `/edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal/` (marked in yellow) in the sidebars to find the correct place for your new page (added in green). In this case, we need to adapt the `edge-solutions.yml` file:

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>sidebar:
  title: Edge Solutions
  URL: /edge-solutions/
  navitems:
    - title: ModuCop
      URL: /edge-solutions/moducop/
      navitems:
        - title: Quick-Start-Guide
          URL: edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/
          navitems:
            - title: Accessories needed for ModuCop Quick Start
              url: /edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/no-starter-kit-bom/
            - title: Connecting to ModuCop's Linux Terminal
              URL: <strong style="color:yellow">/edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal/</strong>
            <strong style="color:green">- title: Demo Page
              URL: /edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/demo-page/</strong>
        - ...
    - ...
</code></pre></div>

## How to Add a New Collapsible Menu to the Sidebar

Assume that the website has the following sidebar and you want to add the menu `Demonstration Menu` after the page highlighted in orange on the same level:

<img src="../../user-docs/images/drafts/sidebar.png" alt="Sidebar" height="300px">

There are two different types of menus:
* Menu which has a landing page
* Menu which has **NO** landing page

The main difference is, that menus with landing pages shall have a folder in the directory structure and menus without landing page **must NOT** have one.

### Add a Menu which has a Landing Page

Get the URL of the page to find the corresponding file in the directory structore:
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>http://localhost:4000/<strong style="color:red">edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal</strong>/
</code></pre></div>

All docs are stored in docs/user-docs/ and grouped by the category, which has to start with `_`:

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>docs/user-docs/_<strong style="color:red">edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal</strong>.md
</code></pre></div>

Now we need to create two files within the directory next to the file discovered:
* File with name in the format `TITLE_SMALL_WITH_HYPHEN.md` -> This is the landing page
* Directory with name `TITLE_SMALL_WITH_HYPHEN` -> All items in the menu shall be placed within this folder

`TITLE_SMALL_WITH_HYPHEN` needs to be the same in both cases and shall be the title converted in small letters where spaces are replaced with `-`. Shorts can be used to keep URL short, as file and directory names are used to generate the URL.

So a good `TITLE_SMALL_WITH_HYPHEN` for our examle would be `demo-menu`.

The next step is to add a front matter at the top of the landing page file:
```yaml
 ---
title: Demonstration Menu
excerpt: This is a menu for demonstration.
last_modified_at: 2021-07-22
 ---
```

After this the landing page of the menu can be visited, as the filename defines the URL together with the filepath:
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>docs/user-docs/_<strong style="color:red">edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/demo-menu</strong>.md
</code></pre></div>

Hosting the webside on your local machine, this would be [http://localhost:4000/edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/demo-menu/](http://localhost:4000/edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/demo-menu/).

But, as you may see, there is stil no reference on the sidebar right now. For this case we need to change the sidebar config file, which is located in `docs/_data/sidebars`. For futher information regarding the sidebar structure, see [section Sidebar](#sidebar).

Search for the reference file `/edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal/` (marked in yellow) in the sidebars to find the correct place for your new page (added in green). In this case, we need to adapt the `edge-solutions.yml` file:

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>sidebar:
  title: Edge Solutions
  URL: /edge-solutions/
  navitems:
    - title: ModuCop
      URL: /edge-solutions/moducop/
      navitems:
        - title: Quick-Start-Guide
          URL: /edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/
          navitems:
            - title: Accessories needed for ModuCop Quick Start
              url: /edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/no-starter-kit-bom/
            - title: Connecting to ModuCop's Linux Terminal
              URL: <strong style="color:yellow">/edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal/</strong>
            <strong style="color:green">- title: Demo Menu
              URL: /edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/demo-menu/</strong>
        - ...
    - ...
</code></pre></div>

The newly created menu looks just as a normal page. We need to add subpages to change that. Add a new file e.g. `demo-page.md` with title `Demonstration Page` in the newly created folder, consider the file [naming conventions](#naming-conventions) and add the front matter.

Now we need to reference that file in the sidebar:
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>            ...
            <strong style="color:green">- title: Demo Menu
              URL: /edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/demo-menu/</strong>
              <strong style="color:orange">navitems:
                title: Demo Page
                URL: <strong style="color:red">/edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/demo-menu/</strong>demo-page</strong>
            ...
</code></pre></div>

The URL for the new file starts with the menu URL, as highlighted in red.

### Add a Menu which has NO Landing Page

In this case, we do not need to add any file in the first step. We just add the menu in the side bar.

Search for the reference file `/edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal/` (marked in yellow) in the sidebars to find the correct place for your new page (added in green). In this case, we need to adapt the `edge-solutions.yml` file:

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>sidebar:
  title: Edge Solutions
  URL: /edge-solutions/
  navitems:
    - title: ModuCop
      URL: /edge-solutions/moducop/
      navitems:
        - title: Quick-Start-Guide
          URL: /edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/
          navitems:
            - title: Accessories needed for ModuCop Quick Start
              url: /edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/no-starter-kit-bom/
            - title: Connecting to ModuCop's Linux Terminal
              URL: <strong style="color:yellow">/edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal/</strong>
            <strong style="color:green">- title: Demo Menu</strong>
        - ...
    - ...
</code></pre></div>

After this step, you can see the menu on the sidebar, but without any functionality. We need to add subpages to change that.

Get the URL of the referenece page to find this page in the directory structure:
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>http://localhost:4000/<strong style="color:red">edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal</strong>/
</code></pre></div>

All docs are stored in docs/user-docs/ and grouped by the category, which has to start with `_`:

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>docs/user-docs/_<strong style="color:red">edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/connect-to-terminal</strong>.md
</code></pre></div>

Add a new file e.g. `demo-page.md` with title `Demonstration Page` next to the reference page, consider the file [naming conventions](#naming-conventions) and add the front matter.

Now we need to reference that file in the sidebar:
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>            ...
            <strong style="color:green">- title: Demo Menu</strong>
              <strong style="color:orange">navitems:
                title: Demo Page
                URL: /edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/demo-page</strong>
            ...
</code></pre></div>

## How to Add a Video
You can add videos hosted by the following providers:
- vimeo
- youtube
- google-drive

A video is added by simply add one markdown file somewhere inside the folder `docs/user-docs/_video/`. Please consider the [naming conventions](#naming-conventions).

Add a front matter to the file:
```yaml
---
title: Cool video
video_id: lolXYZabcbl
provider: youtube
excerpt: Super cool video..
date: 2021-04-13
---
```
This is used to define video metadata:
- **title:** Video Title, same as used in the video platform
- **video_id:** Video ID, depending on the platform. Usually last part of the URL of the video on the video platform
- **provider:** Add one of the supported providers. Default is `vimeo`
- **excerpt:** A short description of the page content
- **date**: Date, when the video was initially added

## How to Add a Video Section
Videos can be grouped by creating a folder in the directory `docs/user-docs/_videos/` and adding the [video markdown files](#how-to-add-a-video) within the this folder.

A video section is defined with a markdown file within the folder `docs/user-docs/_video-categories/`. Please consider the [naming conventions](#naming-conventions).

A video category file has the following front matter:
```yaml
---
title: Super Cool Category
excerpt: All super cool videos.
video_path: _videos/folderName
---
```

This is used to define category metadata:
- **title:** Category Title
- **excerpt:** A short description of the category
- **video_path**: Path to folder created in the first step, base path is `docs/user-docs/`

The last step is to add the video category to the sidebar. This needs to be added in the file `docs/_data/sidebars/video-section`:
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>sidebar:
  title: Video Section
  URL: /video-section/
  navitems:
    - title: ModuCop Videos
      URL: /video-section/moducop/
    - title: EdgeFarm Videos
      URL: /video-section/edgefarm/
    <strong style="color:green">- title: Super Cool Category
      URL: /video-section/super-cool-category/</strong>
</code></pre></div>

The URL to be added is automatically generated and hast the format `/video-section/FILENAME_WITHOUT_FILEENDING/`, where `FILENAME_WITHOUT_FILEENDING` shall be the name of the video category markdown file, previously created.

## How to Use Previous / Next Buttons in Pages
To enable showing previous / next buttons on a page add the following lines to the front matter:
```yaml
custom_previous: /PATH_TO_PREVIOUS_PAGE/
custom_next: /PATH_TO_NEXT_PAGE/
```

The path of a file can be derived from the path in the folder structure, e.g.:
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>docs/user-docs/_<strong style="color:red">edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/demo-menu</strong>.md
</code></pre></div>

leads to
```yaml
custom_previous: /edge-solutions/moducop/quick-start-guide/demo-menu/
```
If one of the two is missing, the previous / next buttons are displayed, but the missing button is not clickable.

# General descriptions
## Sidebar
The following figure shows the sidebar, while visiting a subpage in a deeper menu.

<img src="../../user-docs/images/drafts/sidebar.png" alt="Sidebar" height="300px">

The page currently visited is highlighted in orange. Expanded menus are highlighted in brown (yes, this color is brown). Items in menus are symbolized by an indentation.

So if you follow the menu hierarchy to the item you get:
```
ModuCop > Quick-Start-Guide > Connecting to ModuCop's Linux Terminal
```
Sidebar definitions are stored within markdown files, which are in `docs/_data/sidebars`:
```
_data/sidebars
├── edgefarm.yml
├── edge-solutions.yml
└── video-section.yml
```
Sidebars can include other sidebars, so that different submenus can be separated from each other. This feature is currently not used.

**Include a sidebar:**
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>sidebar:
  title: Example Sidebar
  URL: /example-sidebar/
  navitems:
    <strong style="color:green">- sidebar: SIDEBAR_NAME_WITHOUT_FILE_ENDING</strong>
</code></pre></div>

**Add a page:**
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>sidebar:
  title: Example Sidebar
  URL: /example-sidebar/
  navitems:
    <strong style="color:green">- title: TITLE
      URL: /path/to/file/TITLE_SMALL_WITH_HYPHEN/</strong>
</code></pre></div>

**Add a external link:**
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>sidebar:
  title: Example Sidebar
  URL: /example-sidebar/
  navitems:
    <strong style="color:green">- title: TITLE
      external_URL: URL</strong>
</code></pre></div>

**Add a menu without landing page:**
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>sidebar:
  title: Example Sidebar
  URL: /example-sidebar/
  navitems:
    <strong style="color:green">- title: MENU_TITLE
      URL: /path/to/file/MENU_TITLE_SMALL_WITH_HYPHEN/
      navitems:
      - title: TITLE
        URL: /path/to/file/TITLE_SMALL_WITH_HYPHEN/</strong>
</code></pre></div>

**Add a menu with landing page:**
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<pre><code>sidebar:
  title: Example Sidebar
  URL: /example-sidebar/
  navitems:
    <strong style="color:green">- title: MENU_TITLE
      navitems:
      - title: TITLE
        URL: /path/to/file/TITLE_SMALL_WITH_HYPHEN/</strong>
</code></pre></div>
