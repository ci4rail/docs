IOU01 is a Binary & analogue input/output extension unit for edge applications in rail & busses.

# Features

* 1 slot (7 HP) extension unit for ModuCop Edge Computer
* 2x2 digital inputs / outputs (selectable) via 4-pin spring terminal; 0..110V (nom), load on ground or load on supply
* 2x analogue input via 4-pin spring terminal; Voltage (+/-10V) or current (4..20mA) measurement
  * 24V supply to external sensor
* Usable for direct I/O or as data logger with multiple data streams.
* Galvanic isolation of all inputs and outputs
* EN 50155 compliant (integrated in ModuCop)

IOU01 is an Io4Edge Device, and therefore supports the features common to all Io4Edge devices.
