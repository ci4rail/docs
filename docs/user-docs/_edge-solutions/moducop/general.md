The modular and flexibly expandable Edge Computer ModuCop MEC01 is qualified for use in rail and public transport applications. Due to its flexibility MEC01 adapts to a wide range of vehicle interfaces and thus represents the basic platform for numerous onboard applications.

ModuCop consists of the basic units Power Supply (slot 1), CPU unit (slot 2&3) and various intelligent extension units to cover any application specific interface needs, as e.g. MVB. Build-to-order configuration allows application tailored edge devices with one extension (4 slot / 28 HP), 3 extensions (6 slot / 42 HP) or up to 9 extension (12 slot / 84 HP).

MEC01 features an ARM Quad Core offering the computing power to host additional custom applications up to machine learning algorithms in a containerized environment.

In addition, a variety of wireless connectivity is provided, enabling both a connection to the cloud and a connection to wireless sensor technology in a vehicle.

The edge computer comes as ONE platform, differencing only by application specific power supply and custom configurations. ModuCop is available with various software functionality based on Linux operating system (LMP) and is integrated seamlessly in Ci4Rails cloud services.
