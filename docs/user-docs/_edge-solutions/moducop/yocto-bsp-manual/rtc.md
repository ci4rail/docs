The ModuCop Edge Computer MEC01/02 features a Real-Time Clock (RTC) that is used to keep track of the current time and date, even when the device is powered off.

As the RTC is on the Toradex SoM, you can refer to the [Toradex documentation](https://developer.toradex.com/software/linux-resources/linux-features/real-time-clock-rtc-linux/) for more information about the RTC.
