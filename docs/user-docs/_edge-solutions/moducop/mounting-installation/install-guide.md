## Installation to Wall
Make sure, you are using the correct accessory for wall mounting depending on your ModuCop configuration. For example, a 6-slot ModuCop must be mounted with the corresponding 6-slot wall mount brackets.

Accessories for wall and rack mounting are identical and differ only in the position to be fixed at ModuCop
- S104-ACS03-:  Wall/Rack mount brackets 4 slot
- S104-ACS04-:  Wall/Rack mount brackets 6 slot
- S104-ACS05-:  Wall/Rack mount brackets 12 slot

For guidance on mounting orientation, angles, keep free areas, please refer to [Installation Requirements]({{ '/edge-solutions/moducop/mounting-installation/install-requirement' | relative_url }}).
