# Installation Guidance

## Installation to Wall
Make sure, you are using the correct accessory for wall mounting depending on your ModuCop configuration. For example, a 6-slot ModuCop must be mounted with the corresponding 6-slot wall mount brackets.  

Accessories for wall and rack mounting are identical and differ only in the position to be fixed at ModuCop
- S104-ACS03-:  Wall/Rack mount brackets 4 slot
- S104-ACS04-:  Wall/Rack mount brackets 6 slot
- S104-ACS05-:  Wall/Rack mount brackets 12 slot

For guidance on mounting orientation, angles, keep free areas, please refer to [Installation Requirements]({{ '/edge-solutions/moducop/mounting-installation/install-requirement' | relative_url }}).

### Assembly of Mounting Brackets

* Make sure, threaded bars are properly positioned as shown in the figure below
* Place brackets as shown
* Fix brackets with two screws M2.5x25 (part of mounting kit) to the threaded bar.

### Assembly of ModuCop to Wall

* Select clean and level ground
* Use 2x M3x25 screws per mounting bracket. 
* Start mounting top bracket, then bottom bracket. 

## Installation to DIN Rail

Make sure, you are using the correct accessory and number for DIN rail mounting depending on your ModuCop configuration. 
- S104-ACS02-:  DIN rail mounting kit (contains 2x DIN rail holders)

    * Use 1 mounting kit for ModuCop configurations of 3 to 6 slot width. 
    * Use 2 mounting kits for ModuCop configurations above 6 slots width. 

For guidance on mounting orientation, angles, keep free areas, please refer to [Installation Requirements]({{ '/edge-solutions/moducop/mounting-installation/install-requirement' | relative_url }}).

### Assembly of DIN Rail Holder

* Make sure, threaded bars are properly positioned as shown in the figure below
* Place holder as shown
* Use 2x screw M2.5x8 plus lock washer M2.5 (part of mounting kit) per holder to fix holder to threaded bar as shown in the following figure

### Assembly of ModuCop to 35 mm DIN Rail

* Place the edge computer at an angle of approx. 10° upwards onto the upper edge of the DIN rail. 
* Press the device down slightly and snap it over the lower edge of the DIN rail.

### Removal of ModuCop from 35 mm DIN Rail

* Lift DIN rail holder flanges simultaneously, turn ModuCop slightly forward from the top and remove it downward.  

## Installation to 19'' Sub-Rack
Make sure, you are using the correct accessory for rack mounting depending on your ModuCop configuration. For example, a 6 slot ModuCop must be mounted with 6 slot rack mount brackets.  

Accessories for wall and rack mounting are identical and differ only in the position to be fixed at ModuCop
- S104-ACS03-:  Wall/Rack mount brackets 4 slot
- S104-ACS04-:  Wall/Rack mount brackets 6 slot
- S104-ACS05-:  Wall/Rack mount brackets 12 slot
