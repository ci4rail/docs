IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referrer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request comes and information about browser and operating system.

This is necessary to display our website and to ensure stability and security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR.

There is no tracking, and we do not have direct access to this data, but only receive an anonymous, statistical summary. This includes the address of the previously visited page, the frequency of each page viewed and the number of unique visitors. We do not combine this data with other data.
