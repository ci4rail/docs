WELCOME to the SIO03 Ethernet based tracelet.

# Introduction

The SIO03 is the autonomous vehicle component (tracelet) of our localization solution LYVE. By means of sensor data fusion, SIO03 enables high-precision self-positioning in buses, trains or other powered assets with only one tracelet per vehicle. SIO03 transmits the position information via Ethernet to in-vehicle systems for further processing of the position.
