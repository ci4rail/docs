WELCOME to the SIO02 WLAN based tracelet.

# Introduction

The SIO02 is the autonomous vehicle component (tracelet) of our localization solution LYVE. By means of sensor data fusion, SIO02 enables high-precision self-positioning in buses, trains or other powered assets with only one tracelet per vehicle. SIO02 transmits the position information via WLAN to the land-side infrastructure or to further equipment inside the vehicles.
