Tracelets are the vehicle components in our localization solution.
The position is calculated in the in-vehicle tracelet using sensor fusion of various technologies and transmits the calculated position to further processing systems via IP-based interfaces (WLAN or Ethernet). On the one hand, these can be used in in-vehicle systems (e.g., onboard computers, ITCS systems...). On the other hand, the tracelets also transmit their position to the depot network via WLAN.
