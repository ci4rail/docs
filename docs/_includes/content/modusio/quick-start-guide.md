### Network and Power Connection

When the {{ page.product_name }} is connected to the host via Ethernet, the power should be provided via Power-Over-Ethernet.

ModuSio devices are Class 2 (3,84â€“6,49 W) PoE powered devices. Connect the ModuSio Device to a PoE source that can supply class 2 devices. ModuSios expect the PoE power as phantom power, i.e. using the Ethernet Tx and Rx pins.

#### Select Ethernet as Host Interface

Configure the device for Ethernet operation. The device is configured for Ethernet when it is *NOT* configured for Wifi. So we clear Wifi settings:
```
config> wifi-ssid ""
Delete wifi-ssid
```

You can ignore the message: `Can't set wifi-ssid: ESP_ERR_NVS_NOT_FOUND`. This is normal if wifi has not been configured before.

When using Wifi, supply the ModuSio by a power supply, capable of delivering 12V..24VDC, 5W. Use contacts 5+6 and 7+8 to supply the power. Polarity doesn't matter.

For initial configuration, connect the `SERVICE` interface to a computer using a USB cable.

#### Select Wifi as Host Interface

Configure the device for Wifi operation. You need the Access Point's Name (SSID) and a password.
```
config> wifi-ssid my-access-point-name
config> wifi-pw my-secret-password
```
