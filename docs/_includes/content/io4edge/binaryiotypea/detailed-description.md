### Use Cases

#### How to Connect the Load
Load may be connected to ground (high side switch) or to supply (low side switch).

![Connect Load]({{ '/user-docs/images/edge-solutions/moducop/io-modules/binaryiotypea/use-case-output1.svg' | relative_url }})

**Warning** Do not leave the CI pin open! If the CI pin is left open, one I/O may affect the read-back level of the other I/O!
{: .notice--warning}


#### Using Inputs

In case you want to use a pin as input, you can select whether the input needs to be driven to high or low.
The switching threshold of the input is ~11V.

#### Controlling a DC Motor

This example shows how you can control a DC Motor in both directions:

#### Mixed Application

This example shows how you can use one pin of a group as input and the other pin as output. It also shows that you can supply each group with a different voltage:

### Using the io4edge API to access the Binary I/Os

If you haven't installed yet the io4edge client software, install it now as [described here]({{ page.url | append: "../quick-start-guide" | relative_url }}#getdemosoftware).

Want to have a quick look to the examples? See our [Github repository](https://github.com/ci4rail/io4edge-client-go/tree/main/examples/binaryIoTypeA)

#### Connect to the binary I/O function

To access the binary I/Os, create a *Client* and save it to the variable `c`. Pass as address either a service address or an ip address with port. Examples:
* As a service address: `{{ page.example_device_name }}-binaryIoTypeA`
* As a IP/Port: `192.168.201.1:10002`

We need this client variable for all further access methods.

```go
import (
  "time"
  log "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
  binio "github.com/ci4rail/io4edge-client-go/binaryiotypea"
)

func main() {
    c, err := binio.NewClientFromUniversalAddress(address, time.Second)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to create binio client: %v\n", err)
    }
}
```

### Controlling Output Switches

The API provides two methods to control output switches
* Control a single pin
* Control multiple pins

Control a single pin:
```go
    // switch on binary output #1
    err = c.SetOutput(0, true)
```

Control multiple pins using a bit mask. The second parameter to `SetAllOutputs` is a mask that specifies which outputs are affected:
```go
    // switch on binary output #1, turn off output #2, don't change output #3 and #4
    err := c.SetAllOutputs(0x1, 0x3)

    // switch off all outputs
    err := c.SetAllOutputs(0x0, 0xf)
```

#### Output Watchdog

By default, the outputs keep their commanded state forever, even if the host program has terminated or crashed.

To ensure that outputs are turned off in such cases, the firmware implements a watchdog functionality. The watchdog can be enabled per pin and the watchdog timeout is configurable (but is the same for all pins).

```go
    // set 2 seconds watchdog on output0, but not on other outputs
    if err := c.UploadConfiguration(binio.WithOutputWatchdog(0x1, 2000)); err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("Failed to set configuration: %v\n", err)
    }
```

With that setting, the host must periodically set the switch to "on" within 2 seconds. If it fails to do so, the firmware turns off the output.

#### Overcurrent Protection

The outputs are overcurrent protected. In case an overcurrent condition is detected on one output, ALL outputs are disabled. The firmware attempts after some milliseconds to turn on the previously closed switches again, because the overcurrent may come from a capacitive load or from a temporary short circuit.

If after approx. 50ms the overcurrent condition still remains, ALL outputs enter an error state.
* In the error state, no outputs can be set; inputs can still be read.
* During error state, all 4 LEDs are flashing fast

Application may clear the error state (in case application knows that the root cause of the error vanished):

```go
    err := c.ExitErrorState()
```

This tells the binary output controller to try again. It does however not wait if the recovery was successful or not.

### Reading Inputs

The API provides two methods to read the current state of the pins:
* Get value of a single pin
* Get value of multipe pins

```go
    // read state of I/O #1
    // value will be true, if the level is above the input switching threshold
    value, err := c.Input(0)

    // read state of I/O #1 and #2.
    // values contains then a bit mask with the state of each input
    values, err = c.AllInputs(0x3)
```

#### Fritting

The current drawn by the input circuitry is 0.5mA. To avoid contact corrosion, it is advisable to draw a higher current from time to time. Therefore, the {{ page.product_name }} supports an optional fritting pulse that applies a 10mA pulse for 10ms each second.

Fritting pulse is disabled by default. To enable it:
```go
    // enable fritting for all inputs
    if err := c.UploadConfiguration(binio.WithInputFritting(0xf); err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("Failed to set configuration: %v\n", err)
    }
```

### Input Transient Recording

In data logger applications, you may want to record changes of the inputs.

Therefore the API provides functions to start a *Stream*. At stream creation, you select the pins which you want to monitor for changes.

```go
// start stream, watch for changes on I/O #1 and 2
err = c.StartStream(binio.WithChannelFilterMask(0x3))

// alternatively, use the defaults, i.e. watch for changes on all 4 pins
err = c.StartStream()

```

For each transition, a *Sample* is generated in the stream, each sample contains:
* A timestamp of the transition
* The pin that changed
* New value of the pin

For efficiency, multiple samples are gathered are sent as one *Bucket* to the host.
To read samples from the stream:

```go
  for {
    // read next bucket from stream
    sd, err := c.ReadStream(time.Second * 1)

    if err != nil {
      log.Errorf("ReadStreamData failed: %v\n", err)
    } else {
      samples := sd.FSData.GetSamples()
      fmt.Printf("got stream data seq=%d ts=%d\n", sd.Sequence, sd.DeliveryTimestamp)

      for i, sample := range samples {
        fmt.Printf("  #%d: ts=%d channel=%d %t\n", i, sample.Timestamp, sample.Channel, sample.Value)
      }
    }
  }
```

#### Controlling the Stream

{% capture example_keep_alive %}
```go
  // configure stream to send the bucket at least once a second
  err = c.StartStream(
    binio.WithFBStreamOption(functionblock.WithKeepaliveInterval(1000)),
  )
```
{% endcapture %}


{% capture example_all_options %}
```go
  // configure stream to send the bucket at least once a second
  // configure the maximum samples per bucket to 25
  // configure low latency mode
  // configure the buffered samples to 200
  err = c.StartStream(
      binio.WithFBStreamOption(functionblock.WithKeepaliveInterval(1000)),
      binio.WithFBStreamOption(functionblock.WithBucketSamples(25)),
      binio.WithFBStreamOption(functionblock.WithLowLatencyMode(true))
      binio.WithFBStreamOption(functionblock.WithBufferedSamples(200)),
  )
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include content/io4edge/functionblock/stream-common.md example_keep_alive=example_keep_alive example_all_options=example_all_options describe_low_latency=true %}

#### Multiple Clients

It is possible to have multiple clients. Example usage:
* Each client has its own stream. One client may have a stream that records transitions on I/O #1, while another client records transitions on I/O #2, #3 and #4.
* One client is reading the current state of the I/Os, while another client is recording transitions and a third client is writing to an I/O.
