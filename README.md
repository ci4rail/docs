#### Fixing errors

**Fixing `Could not open library 'libcurl'` error**
1. Download [curl](https://curl.se/windows/) (curl for 64 bit)
2. Unpack zip file
3. Go to bin folder and rename `libcurl-x64.dll` to `libcurl.dll`
4. Copy the file `libcurl.dll` to the directory `C:\Ruby27-x64` while `27` has to be replaced by actual Ruby version


**Fixing `cannot load such file webrick` error**
This fix is included in latest `Gemfile`.

Run `bundle update` in `docs` folder before starting jekyll page.

## Pre-Commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks are used to ensure a minimum level of quality in each commit.

Pre-commit hook require a installation of Python Pip on the system. If not already installed, do this before:
* On Windows, this is included in [Python installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* On Linux install Pip directly e.g. `apt install python3-pip`

Afterwards install pre-commit:

```
pip3 install pre-commit
```

Install pre-commit hooks in repository:
```
pre-commit install
```

> Note: After each fresh checkout of a repository `pre-commit install` has to be repeated.
